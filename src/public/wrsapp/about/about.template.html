        I'm George. I'm a software developer and a chemical engineer. I live in the city of Baltimore. I'm passionate
        about learning new skills and expanding my education. I like to work on teams with intelligent people who enjoy
        discussing new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've made this website to try out a few ideas and promote myself a bit. My dayjob is mostly backend
        programming, so I'd like exercise my front-end muscles with this site. I'm working on a few projects to add to this
        site. Look for those soon.
