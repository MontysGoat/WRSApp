        I'm George. I'm a software developer. I used to be a chemical engineer, but I made the switch to software when I
        figured out I didn't like living in the middle of nowhere. I thoroughly enjoyed engineering, but I've really
        come to
        love development. I get to work on projects with other smart people. I get to learn new things all the time and
        test out new ideas quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've made this website to try out a few ideas and promote myself a bit. My dayjob is mostly backend
        programming, so I'd like exercise my front-end muscles with this site. The projects tab will always be a work in
        progress, but I hope to have a few things up soon.
